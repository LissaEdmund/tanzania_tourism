    <h1>Overview of Tanzania</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Tanzania, officially known as the <strong>United Republic of Tanzania</strong>, 
      is a sovereign nation in East Africa formed by the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar on 26 April 1964. 
      This historic merger created one of the most politically stable and culturally rich nations on the continent. 
      Tanganyika achieved independence from British colonial rule on 9 December 1961, and Zanzibar followed on 10 December 1963, 
      before the revolutionary overthrow of the Sultan on 12 January 1964. 
      Tanzania's historical significance is further rooted in ancient trade routes, notably the Swahili coast's connections to Arabia, Persia, India, and the Far East dating back to the 9th century. 
      Towns like Kilwa Kisiwani and Bagamoyo were major hubs during the height of the slave and ivory trade, 
      later becoming critical sites during colonial resistance movements against the Germans and British. 
      The discovery of early human fossils and footprints in Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli by Drs. Louis and Mary Leakey solidified Tanzania as the “Cradle of Mankind”. 
      The country is administratively divided into 31 regions (as of the 2022 administrative reforms), an increase from 26 in previous decades. According to the 2022 Population and Housing Census, 
      Tanzania's population stands at 61,741,120, reflecting steady growth from 44.9 million in 2012, with an annual growth rate of 2.9% (NBS, 2022). The population density varies significantly, with Dar es Salaam being the most densely populated region.

   Tanzania is endowed with a vast network of rivers, lakes, wetlands, and forest ecosystems, making it one of the most ecologically diverse countries in Africa. 
   It borders three of Africa's largest lakes: Lake Victoria (the world's second-largest freshwater lake), 
   Lake Tanganyika (Africa’s deepest lake and second-deepest in the world), and Lake Nyasa/Malawi. 
   Additionally, inland water bodies like Lake Eyasi, Lake Manyara, and Lake Natron hold significant ecological and cultural value, 
   serving as habitats for endemic species such as the lesser flamingo and various tilapia species. 
   The Rufiji River Tanzania’s longest feeds into the Indian Ocean and supports rich delta ecosystems, 
   especially within the Selous Game Reserve and Nyerere National Park.Forest reserves, covering over 38% of Tanzania's total land area, 
   include globally recognized biodiversity hotspots such as the Eastern Arc Mountains (Uluguru, Usambara, and Udzungwa) and the Miombo woodlands. 
   These forests are conserved under institutions like the Tanzania Forest Services Agency (TFS) and include Nature Forest Reserves such as Amani, Chome, Minziro, and Kilombero. 
   Tanzania’s marine ecosystems spanning islands such as Zanzibar, Pemba, Mafia, and numerous coral islets are managed through the Marine Parks and Reserves Unit (MPRU) and 
   support critical marine biodiversity, including coral reefs, whale sharks, and endangered dugongs. 
   Together, these ecosystems support tourism, fisheries, and water security for millions of Tanzanians (MNRT, 2022).

    Despite economic growth, Tanzania faces challenges in living standards. 
    As of the Household Budget Survey (HBS) 2020/21 by the National Bureau of Statistics, the national poverty rate stands at 26.4%, 
    a slight decline from 28.2% in 2012. The average household monthly consumption expenditure was TSh 414,352, with rural areas trailing significantly behind urban centers. 
    Access to electricity has improved remarkably from 7% in 2011 to 39.9% by 2021, 
    with Dar es Salaam and other urban regions nearing full coverage. Clean water access remains a concern in rural regions, 
    with less than 55% of households having reliable sources. Tanzania is experiencing moderate technological advancement. 
    As of 2022, mobile phone penetration reached 85%, and internet connectivity expanded to more than 29 million users, 
    largely due to 4G LTE expansion in urban areas (TCRA, 2022). The government’s Digital Tanzania Project a collaboration with the World Bank aims to increase broadband access, 
    digital skills, and e-governance platforms across the country by 2030. Innovations in mobile banking (e.g., M-Pesa, Tigo Pesa) have transformed financial inclusion, 
    with over 60% of adults accessing mobile money services (FSDT, 2022). Additionally, the government has invested in e-learning platforms
    and digital identity systems to enhance access to services and education.

    Tanzania has been identified as one of Africa's most attractive destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI). 
    According to the Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC), FDI inflows rose to $1.1 billion in 2022, 
    driven largely by investments in mining, agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, and energy. 
    The Strategic Investment Act of 2022 has improved investor confidence by offering tax incentives and access to strategic land. 
    Special Economic Zones (SEZs), such as those in Bagamoyo, Kigamboni, and Dodoma, attract investors through reduced regulatory hurdles and improved infrastructure.
    On water, major investments focus on marine transport, fisheries, and tourism. 
    Port expansion projects such as the Dar es Salaam Maritime Gateway Project (DMGP) and the planned Bagamoyo Mega Port aim to enhance Tanzania's competitiveness as a logistics hub. 
    Inland water investment includes the development of ports in Mwanza, Kigoma, and Itungi, supporting trade on Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, and Nyasa.
    The industrial sector contributes approximately 8.4% to GDP (World Bank, 2023) and is driven by agro-processing, textiles, beverages, cement, 
    and mineral refining. The Industrialization Strategy (2015–2025) aims to transform Tanzania from a raw material exporter to a manufacturing hub. 
    The government has also invested in energy production, including the Julius Nyerere Hydropower Project (2,115 MW) on the Rufiji River, expected to power industrial and residential growth.
